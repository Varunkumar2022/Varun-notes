To login to the AKS following commands in bash command prompt
---> az aks get-credentials --resource-group RG-1 --name AKS-cluster001
for login into AKS we need to provide above command with details like resource-group name, AKS cluster name
-- we will receive following output text 
Merged "AKS-cluster001" as current context in /home/varun/.kube/config
---> next we need to give "kubectl get nodes" command, we will get the list of nodes in the cluster
---> next we need to create one yaml file using below sequence of commands
"nano azure-vote.yaml" [create yaml file]
"kubectl apply -f azure-vote.yaml" [apply the yaml file]
after this u will get following text
"""
deployment.apps/azure-vote-back unchanged
service/azure-vote-back unchanged
deployment.apps/azure-vote-front configured
service/azure-vote-front unchanged
"""
---> Next execute following command 
"kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch"
--> the following text will be displayed after couple of minutes [nearly 30 minutes] u will find "EXTERNAL-IP" 
copy the IP address u find below "EXTERNAL-IP" section and bowse in a browser, we can access the application.

"""
